# E-Trading Post
## Auction site style web application
v1.1

E-Trading Post is a product listing site which allows users to add products for sale. Products can either be listed as either auction or 'buy it now'. 

This web application was built as part of my Diploma course in ICT (Back end web development). Currently, the application allows any user to add or edit products on the site. The project required me to design the UI and develop the CRUD functionality for the application. On future developments I would add user sign up and login to allow only registered users to add products and product owners to edit their own listings.

During the development process I encountered issues uploading files to the virtual machine hosted on my local computer running XAMPP. Through reading the PHP documentation and articles online I was able to successfully integrate the `basename` and `move_uploaded_file` functions to allow users to upload images.

## Technologies used
This project was built with HTML, CSS, PHP and MyPHPAdmin. I designed the UI using Figma.
