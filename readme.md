# E-Trading Post web app

This web application was built as part of my Diploma studies in back end web development. The app is an auction style site for users to sell items within Australia. Users can choose whether to sell items in an auction or for immediate sale.

## Technologies used
This project was built with HTML, CSS, PHP and MyPHPAdmin. I designed the UI using Figma.
